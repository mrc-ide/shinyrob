# shinyrob
A data visualisation Shiny app for ANC and ART data for Naomi

App can be found at [this link](https://shinyrob.unaids.org/)

ANC and ART data are made available in the app through the use of an ADR access key through the AIDS Data Repository - you can find yours <a href="https://adr.unaids.org/me">here</a>

* Choose where you’d like it downloaded
* In RStudio, open `shinyrob/installation_setup.R` from the newly downloaded folder
